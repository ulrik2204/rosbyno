      at Oda using information extracted from product images. Here we focused on working in a cross-functional
      team of designers, data scientists and software engineers. Although my role was primarily as a software 
      developer, we also did a Google Design Sprint to create a prototype of the product, did process
      modeling using BPMN diagrams and created an application which integrated with their already existing 
      system to provide suggestion for product data based on images.
